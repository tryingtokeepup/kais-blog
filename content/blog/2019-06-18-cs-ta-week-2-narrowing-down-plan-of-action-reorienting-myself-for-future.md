So, I went over my plan of action with my instructor, and we decided to drop a few things to make it so that I'm not as overwhelmed in the future.



1: Get the Lambda Showcase work done. This will come to an end on the 27th, so it's not much longer.\
Dry run on the 25th, with one last meeting on the 24th with one of the honchos. I need to coordinate a few more things with my team to get a nice NameCheap domain up with our netlify on that, but other than that, we are good to go. 

2: Work on perfecting my GPs, that will tie into my overall Algo/DS/Graphs training

\
3: Work on the Tyler stuff, go through that course and the adv. JS course (This will be a long time in coming, maybe 1-2 weeks)

will update
