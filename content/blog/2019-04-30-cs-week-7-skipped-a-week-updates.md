title: 'CS Week 7 - Skipped a week, updates!'

I missed last week; it was probably one of the most hectic and exhausting weeks I've had at Lambda, more because of all the things thrown on me rather than the content. Learning C is crazy, but I think it's manageable, but now with job hunting and interview prep and the Pioneer tourney and Sayo's immigration stuff thrown in, I'm just trying not to get buried.

For this week, C is a lot more manageable, simply because I have a great teacher in the form of James Page, C-extraordinaire. For today's docket, I got my whiteboard practice in the morning, lecture until 11, and a whole afternoon of C behind that. I got to fill out some stuff for my fiance's visa stuff, which I might detail someday for anyone who is stressed out about that. It really is an overwhelming amount of work, and I will probably need to hunker down and just get it all done before I can speak on how to survive the rest of May.
