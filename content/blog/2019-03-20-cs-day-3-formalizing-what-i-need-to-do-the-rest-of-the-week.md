title: CS Day 3 - Formalizing what I need to do the rest of the week

So, here was the previous todo list or at least stuff  I wanted to do:

* Get an account on AlgoTutor and start doing 2 problems a day
* After the above, apply to TripleByte and make my job-hunt a little more efficent
* Watch the company presentations, and apply to them
* To do so, I need a cleaned up resume, and a strong LinkedIn (almost there!)
* Plus, I need a updated, clean portfolio, hopefully something I can accomplish this week
* Read the Data Struct/Algo in Python book (seems really good)
* Apply to the Pioneer/Lambda challenge to maximize chances to stipend 
* Which means building out that idea from Bad Version 
* Reach out to the Punahou community in LinkedIn, my only viable community out here
* Reach out to the recruiters I talk to before, figure out how to build out some sort of network
* and of course, keep up with coursework

And now, I have a few more added:

* use my new kailovingfoss.me github page to make a clean portfolio site
* work on codesignal with bondor to get stronger at python syntax
* while at it, i wonder if i should keep reading more js stuff
* talk to k. lin about interviews and what i should focus on
* check out the skilledinc site for the future
* and ... well, that's about all for now, but im sure there's other stuff lurking

So I think there are three buckets that I need to put all this stuff in:

* Career Prep (Portfolio, resume, LinkedIn, GitHub Page, talking to ex-Lambda Students, getting CC verified)
* Projects and Lambda work (Pioneer, Lambda Course Work)
* Coding and Algorithims (SkilledInc, AlgoTutor, TripleByte, CodeSignal, CS course work)

There's other stuff like social matters and all, but I think I need to focus on the top three things. The rest can basically wait. Finishing my course work is priority, of course, but the Career prep is a very close second. But I can't do all of that without becoming better at algos and data structures (because even if I get interviews, I will fail if I am not prepared), so there's that.

The last big question in my head is if I should commit to being a generalist, software engineer, or if I should tout the whole front-end stuff a lot more strongly. I gravitate towards the backend, and I like projects that deal with algorithms A LOT more than front-end work. I need to ask about this. I also want to start fleshing out an overall plan to get that Revvr project off the ground.
