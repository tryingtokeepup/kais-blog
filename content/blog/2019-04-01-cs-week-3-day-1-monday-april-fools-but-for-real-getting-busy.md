So, I wasn't able to make the most progress this weekend, but I think I have a handle. For now, I need to finish the whiteboard practicing and the resume.

For the most part, I picked a nice template from HTML5up for inspiration. I will change it as much as possible in the next few days, and convert it to a react app (it might be tricky to upload it without netlify's help, but we will see). 

Other than that, I will hold off on working on the Pioneer submission until Friday, and focus on finishing the resume and hosting that on the portfolio site. Once the resume is done, I can update LinkedIn.

Then, clean up my twitter account and make it my official dev account, link my github, twitter, and linkedin to the portfolio site, and pin my projects on github, and submit all of that to my career counselor. 

If i can do that all by this week and maintain progress on algoexpert, i will be exceeding expectations. i hope i can maintain this pace.
