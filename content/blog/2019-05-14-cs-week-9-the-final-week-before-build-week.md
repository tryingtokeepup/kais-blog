This is it, this is the beginning of the end, and the beginning of my career hunt. I started going hard into careers about a month ago, but it's only now that I've been endorsed and have a strong resume and portfolio that I feel strong enough to brave the market. It seems pretty hot right now, so I'll start using this blog as a faithful and honest record of how it goes for me. Hopefully, it can be useful to other's that go through Lambda in the future.
