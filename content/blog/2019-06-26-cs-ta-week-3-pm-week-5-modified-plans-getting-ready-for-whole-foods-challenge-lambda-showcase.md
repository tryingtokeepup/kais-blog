So, today is the day before the Lambda Showcase.

\
I'm writing this up so I can unload my brain really fast before I give my lecture on Heaps and Binary Search Trees. It's a little disconcerting that I haven't had a chance to go over AVLs and Red/Black trees myself; I want to fix that, along with checking my knowledge on quicksort, selection sort, and timsort. I think Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Insertion sort are alright on my end.

Algorithms that I haven't finished: knapsack, matrix spiral, and some other random stuff that I haven't had the time to go over, but those first two need to be fixed up. I think I got a good handle on most of the Data Structs, but I wouldn't mind checking up on Brady's lecture from the previous day and fast watching it. I also need to watch Brady's video for the PMs, because that might help me with the Whole Foods interview.

I reached out to the Amazon Data visualization team lead; hopefully that is fruitful, but if not, I'll move on. She seems super nice, but she's probably ridiculously busy. I still have a warm lead in Instacart; once the showcase is over, that's something I will follow up on, along with getting those graph videos into my head. I need to work on the colored graph problem too; it seems everything leads into that. 

It would be great to talk to Jonathan again about React, the recursive fetch operation for that nested JSOn object problem, and some other stuff, but I think catching him when he has time is difficult. I'll see if I can solve it myself; I need to work on React too as soon as possible with Tyler's videos. 

I also should finish up some code reviews and that thing that Josue wants about the students. I'll try to do that during the 11-12 PM break. I also need to rerecord that 2 min presentation with the updated getstockly.com website. See how that goes. 



1) Finish GP prep, do GP (remind that Brady might be taking over tomorrow)

2) Code Reviews, eval of students (11-12)

3) Brady's video on Whole foods (12-1)

4) Maybe time with Brady? (1-1:30)

5) Re-record Stockly pres, change one picture on slide (1:30-2)

6) Attempt either Whole Foods Challenge or Work on React Skills, Sayo (2-4 PM)

7) Team Standup and Exercise (4PM - 6PM)

8) ???? React, work with Lukas, rest, read my favorite stuff, check Presentation (6-8PM)

9) Chat with Sayo, go to bed (8-9:30)
