So, today is a pretty important day for myself. I think that I have a good idea of what I need to do for next few weeks.

I was able to talk to my career coach and make a plan for this week. 

For this weekend, I need to get my portfolio website done, work on algoexpert, finish my python game for completion sake, and finally get my resume and LinkedIn cleaned up. This is so that I have something to show Gigi on Monday, and I get on track to finish all the AlgoExpert videos by this month. There are a lot of opportunities and interviews waiting for me if I just get all this work done. 

On the side, it would be nice to clean up my old build week's project and notes project and put them up on Netlify to satisfy the portfolio requirements. I will try to get time to do that too.

Finally, I need to submit my idea to Pioneer and discuss project ideas with the old Lab team. 

Busy busy busy.
