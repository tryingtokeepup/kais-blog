Yayy, survived this week. Dang it was hectic. But it was an awesome experience. I think that this week cemented some important concepts in my head on how to organize a strong project for my personal apps, and it also highlighted my comparable skill at backend code and my lack of it in styling and overall understanding of how React components work together. I know how to hack a solution together, and even know the academic side of how HOCs work, but I really need to hammer together another React app to solidify what I have almost lost since Labs.

Tomorrow, I will be solidifying the React app that will host the marketing page material, the Auth0 login, and the basic graphQL BE that will take in the Flask API which holds the trained ML algo. I don't need everything functioning yet, but it's got to be up there for people to start playing around with.

My resume and my personal website are almost complete, which is at least a week behind schedule but I can't rush things at this point. I'm already getting exhausted from a lack of a break from working, but I need to push just a bit more to get everything ready by the end of May. 

I will try to update this post tomorrow to write down the exact flow of information that we built out for the Build week, but we'll see if time can permit that.
