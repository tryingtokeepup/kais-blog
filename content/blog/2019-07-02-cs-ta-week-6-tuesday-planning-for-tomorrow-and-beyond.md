So, yesterday, I wrote this out:

> The companies I am going for currently:

* Whole Foods (Amazon) - Intro interview done
* Amazon (Data Visualization w/ Python) - Need to follow up with my Showcase video
* Keyo (talk to Jonathan and tell him I'm going to apply)
* MyCrypto (waiting on Jai to tell me what the next step is)
* AutoDesk (Loom + waiting on Ben Crane to tell me next step)
* GitLab (need to apply today and tell Brent Anderson to push it up)
* Facebook (eventually need to pass Instructor's test and then I can go for this big one)
* Box (need to apply through Breezy)
* Instacart (use Todd's reference to get into system)

> So, for today, here's the plan:

* 3 PM-4PM - Loom Video, follow up on showcase video for Amazon
* 4-5PM - Workout and take a shower
* 5PM-6PM - Eat food, write cover letter
* 6PM-7PM - apply to Keyo and GitLab and Instacart and perhaps Box
* 7PM -8PM - Check out Breezy for some other stuff, get ready for next day, rest.



I was able to use today to get most of the work done, except for the applications to Keyo, Gitlab, and Instacart. I don't think I'm going to do Breezy checks just yet; I'm getting tired and I want to focus on just the companies I have some sort of personal relationship with. I might give it a look later this week, but I want those above three companies done by tomorrow, if possible. 

I have a 10am session with my mentor, and possibly another call at 9am, depending on what happens with a recruiter that pinged me on LinkedIn.   We will have to see how that transpires. Either way, tomorrow, I will be working heavily on React, so that I am prepared for Thursday. I also hope to write up a cover letter in the morning, so I have something to quickly throw at those three jobs. I have no idea if I ask for a referral or anything of that nature for all of them; I'll just figure it out from here. Probably not? Maybe I will just to be safe. 

So yeah, I accomplished most of everything I needed to do; just took double the time, and I need to get ready for React and Graphs tomorrow, along with talking to a few people about ... stuff. Going to be interesting. I'll see if I can survive Thursday hahah.
