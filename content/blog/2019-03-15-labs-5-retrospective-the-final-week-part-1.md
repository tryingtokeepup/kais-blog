# Part 1 - Individual Accomplishments this Week

Github Handle: [tryingtokeepup](https://github.com/tryingtokeepup)

Week 5. We made it. 

I made it. Without running away. That's going to be a cherished victory.

The main accomplishment this week was being the lead on remaking our landing page, with Eileen being my mentor, confidant, and all-around teacher so that I could make something not completely embarrassing. I was just barely able to get everything responsive by today, Friday morning, and this is by no means a small accomplishment for me, as I have utter dog poop at design, html, and css. It's my true weakness, and I am glad that I had to face my fears by going through this crucible. 

 

## Tasks Pulled

This week, in Technical Accomplishments:

As above, the big technical accomplishment was making a decent looking landing page. It's not 100 percent feature complete (I want to add better transitions and animations, better shadows for boxes, actual links for privacy and team links, and overall find a way to lighten the backdrop and add non-euclidean geometry into the page to spice it up), but it will suffice for now. It is clean, easy on the eyes, and gets the right information to you. It's not the best landing page in Labs10, but its not the worst, and it does its job on any device size, which was the big technical win for me this week.

Could not have done that without Eileen. Seriously.

## Detailed Analysis



# Part 2 - Bringing the Project to a Close

It is really difficult to just stop and say, "Hey, this is good enough, lets ship." It's a cliche that artists and engineers never truly feel that their creations are ready to stand the public's gaze, but it really is true. When you have poured in countless hours for a month straight into just one project, you get attached to it.
