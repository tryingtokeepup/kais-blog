## Another day, another thingy. 

So, this week in CS was a doozy. They threw the whole data structure list at us, heaps and linked lists and double linked lists and binary search trees and AVLs and more. It was insanity, not sure if everything sunk in but our cohort survived even the insane ring buffer question. 

The great thing about the sprint challenge this week is that there was no previous cohort answers to crib off of if one was desperate to pass or too lazy to give an attempt at solving the problem. You had to actually come up with the answer yourself, so the very fact that almost all of us made it means we are the real deal. I am so proud of our group.

I also got my <https://www.kailovingfoss.me> to finally render properly, albeit incomplete. I fixed the https issue, properly got the IP addresses configured to use the namecheap education url to properly work, and even modified the Dimension template to have much more of a personal touch. It is such an excellent template that it hurts to modify some of it, but that's what I've been trained to do, so I am tinkering with abandon. 

The Pioneer challenge starts tomorrow, so I have a lot of stuff on my plate to juggle, but I got a lot of backing and I think I can do this. I just need to focus. I was able to link up with Jonathan Heinz and work on fixing up the blog to have a filter, so that's some progress too.

I haven't been able to work on algoexpert as much as I have been hoping, but there's just so many hours in the day to work on everything. I will rush it this week. 

Tomorrow, I need to work on the Pioneer challenge and finish the portfolio content for the portfolio site, which includes having a link to my current resume, which means that has to be done too. Busy busy, but at least I have a plan.
