CS has been a blast so far. I haven't finished my game project as I wanted, so I am going to get that darn thing finished tomorrow if it's the last thing I do.

I am going to work on graph questions and algorithms in the morning, and try to get on AlgoExpert by the afternoon. I also need to work on Sayo's documents for her arrival to the U.S. 

Things are starting to pick up. I need to keep on my toes.
